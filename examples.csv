A letter to the government asking why my disability benefit has been declined.,"Dear ______, 

I am writing to ask why my disability benefit has been declined. I have been receiving this benefit for many years and it has been a great help to me in managing my condition. I was recently told that my benefit would be discontinued, and I would like to know why this decision was made. As you may know, I have a disability that prevents me from working full- time. This benefit has allowed me to maintain my independence and live a reasonably normal life. Without it, I would be forced to rely on others for financial support, which would be very difficult for me. I would appreciate it if you could let me know why my benefit was declined, and if there is any way that I can appeal this decision. 
Thank you for your time.

A letter to the government asking how Canada Pension Plan (CPP) work,"Dear Government,

I am writing to ask how the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) works. I am specifically interested in how contributions are calculated and how benefits are paid out.

I understand that the CPP is a mandatory retirement savings plan for all working Canadians. Contributions are deducted from paycheques and are matched by employers. The money is then invested and grows over time.

I am curious about how the amount of one's contributions is calculated. Is it a percentage of one's income? And how are benefits calculated? Are they based on how much one has contributed, or on other factors?

I would appreciate any information you can provide on how the CPP works. Thank you in advance for your time.
